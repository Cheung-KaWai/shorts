# shorts

Recently I moved from windows to mac and one of the annoying things are relearning all the shortcuts again for visual studio code. That's why I'm going to create shorts, an app to learn all the shortcuts in a quiz like format. For the moment I'm planning to make it for personal use, but who knows I'll publish it one day and extend it with shortcuts for other applications.
